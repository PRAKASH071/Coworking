Well, probably we’re exaggerating a bit but they&#x27;re more or less similar images. But now if we tell you that &quot;office&quot; could also mean meeting new people, engaging in diverse conversations, flexible working hours, sipping latte &amp; working in a relaxed environment? How does that sound?<br/><br/>‍<br/>This is possible with coworking. With the rising demand for hybrid work models, there has been <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/08/reimagining-the-urban-office">a significant rise in the number of coworking spaces</a> as well. But let&#x27;s not delve into the complicated path right away. First, let’s understand what coworking is.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>What is coworking? </strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>Coworking is basically an arrangement where people from different companies share a workspace. It’s different from a typical office in the sense that people in a coworking environment generally aren&#x27;t employees of the same company. This allows cost savings &amp; convenience through the use of common infrastructure. Now, it doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to share pens and staplers with other workers. Mostly, equipment, utilities, refreshment services, etc. are shared &amp; nothing else. The amenities offered by coworking spaces are similar to what you would find in a traditional office, along with a lot more. A major differentiator between the two is flexibility, since you wouldn’t have to sign a long-term lease in a coworking space. The vibe of a coworking space is surely different from that of a regular office. The smell of fresh coffee &amp; the positive energy of the people working there is a definite mood booster. </p><p>Coworking spaces are mainly popular among startups and freelancers. Since freelancers or remote workers work for themselves, this sort of pay-as-you-go type of arrangement helps them save a lot. Other than that, a coworking space is also an excellent place to network as it  provides a great opportunity to meet other freelancers &amp; entrepreneurs. It is highly likely that in this neutral space, you&#x27;ll meet people who are working on things similar to yours. This provides you with a chance to engage with those people &amp; chat with them about your shared interests which might give you a deeper understanding of your own work. It&#x27;s not just the small businesses &amp; freelancers who use coworking spaces. Large global enterprises like Nike, have also partnered with coworking companies to handle their workspace needs.</p><h3>‍<br/><strong>What is hybrid work culture?</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>Now coming to the &quot;hybrid work culture&quot; part, it is much like what its title suggests. The concept of hybrid working is quite flexible. Employees working in a hybrid organization tend to commute to the office a few times a week &amp; work remotely the rest of the time. In hybrid working, you get the best of both worlds. Apart from that, this working model provides workers with more flexibility, freedom &amp; autonomy, which helps in the long run by <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/01/thriving-in-the-age-of-hybrid-work">increasing productivity &amp; overall job satisfaction.</a> For employers, hybrid working not only empowers the workforce but also saves them a fortune in terms of office maintenance costs.</p><p>The current health crisis has most certainly changed the traditional approach towards work. It has posed challenges for companies &amp; forced them to opt for work from home policies. The idea of a hybrid work model has given a ray of hope to cope with the ongoing crisis as organizations are still struggling to become fully functional. And with the demand for hybrid working, the demand for coworking spaces has also been rising. Much like Facebook, Microsoft, Google &amp; other large organizations, the Indian multinational Information Technology company Infosys has announced work from home for 33% to 55% of its employees. TCS too has declared that only 25% of its employees will need to attend its offices by 2025. </p><p>This is where coworking spaces enter the picture. Since lockdown rules keep changing, many workers believe that it&#x27;s better &amp; safer for them to work at coworking spaces. The primary reason for them to opt for a coworking space is that they don&#x27;t really feel motivated while working alone. They feel that it&#x27;s easier to get distracted at home &amp; not to forget the power outages or network connectivity issues. Keeping in mind that work from home cannot be a permanent set-up for countries like India, coworking spaces are hoping to act as &quot;solution spaces” while companies try to figure out what&#x27;s best for them &amp; what might be the new normal in a post-pandemic world.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>The rise of coworking spaces across India<br/></strong><br/></h3><p>Over the past decade, the number of shared workspaces in the world has grown by a significant percent &amp; so has the number of people working there. In India, the growth is predominantly visible in the big metropolitan cities, mainly Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad &amp; New Delhi. Currently, it is spreading across various Tier-2 Indian cities as well. There are numerous coworking spaces operating across the country with premium looking positive ambiance, flexible plans &amp; unlimited coffee. </p><h3><strong>Why 2gethr is the solution to all your coworking needs <br/></strong>‍</h3><p>Bangalore-based 2gethr is one which ideally fits the picture of a perfect coworking space.
